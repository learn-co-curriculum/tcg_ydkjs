# You Don't Know JS

## Learning Goals

Master the 'Deep Fundamentals' of Javascript

## Introduction

The book series [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) is available on Github. The series comprises six mini-books.

Up & Going
Scope & Closures
this & Object Prototypes
Types & Grammar
Async & Performance
ES6 & Beyond

The books are meant to be read in order. Completing the whole series should take 6-10 focused hours.

You can tackle the book in chunks. Set time on your calendar, with events named something like 'YDKJS: Chapter 1-2'. Work your way from the beginning to the end. Do not skip the quizzes and exercises! Even if they appear simple, they help you know for sure that you have actually learned the material in each chapter, not just skimmed.
